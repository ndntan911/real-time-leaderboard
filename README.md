## Description

The Real-Time Leaderboard project is a backend service designed to manage and display real-time leaderboards for various games. It provides a comprehensive set of features for user authentication, game management, and score tracking. Users can sign up, log in, and submit their scores, which are then used to generate dynamic leaderboards. The service includes robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, ensuring secure access to protected routes. It leverages technologies like TypeScript, NestJS, TypeORM, PostgreSQL, and Redis to deliver high performance and scalability. Additionally.
